*** TODO We should perhaps return nil as root's root.
*** TODO The semantic of length is probably unclear.  Should return the node_depth instead (or remove the method)


* Unplanned / Not assigned to any release
*** TODO Fix the TreeNode#root method to return nil for root's root.
*** TODO Fix the marshal_load method.  This probably needs to be a class method.

*** DONE Fix bug # [[http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php%3Ffunc%3Ddetail&aid%3D22535&group_id%3D1215&atid%3D4793][22535]]: The method Tree::TreeNode#depth is a misnomer.  The current definition actually provides the height function.
