    CLOSED: [2010-02-23 Tue 22:03]
    There really is no good default to this situation.  We will return 'true' simply because there is no other sibling
    to a root.  However, a good case can be made that a root node does not have any parent either.

* R0.8.3
  This is a bugfix release.

*** TODO Update documentation to be more explicit about duplicate node names
    Issue https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree/issues/7
    Update documentation for :name attribute in tree.rb.  There is no
    specific code fix needed.

*** DONE Allow integers to be used as node names (and clarify the scenario). Fixed issue #6.

    Issue https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree/issues/6
    We will need to warn the user when an Integer is used as a name
    for the node (but still allow the usage),
    and
    also add an optional flag to the TreeNode#[] method to allow the
    user to explicitly indicate use of the Integer parameter as a
    literal name, and not as an /index/ to the children array.

*** TODO Resolve the _tree.rb_ file conflict with the [[http://netaddr.rubyforge.org/][netaddr gem]]
    Issue https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree/issues/8

*** TODO [#A] Resolve the infinite loop bug if a node is added to itself as a child
    Issue https://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree/issues/5

    This is a subtle problem to resolve.  The specific case of a node
    being added to itself is trivial to resolve, and the fix has been
    put in for 0.8.3.

    However, the general problem is that in the current code, a node
    can be added as a child to any portion of the tree down the
    hierarchy (e.g., as a grandchild), which will need a more thorough
    detection code in the ~TreeNode#add~ method, if it is to be done at
    runtime.

    The issue is really to prevent the tree becoming a graph.  Note
    that the issue is with duplicate nodes, /not/ duplicated content.

    A few options exist:
    1. Perform a runtime check in the ~TreeNode#add~ method.  This will
       cause a performance hit as the tree becomes larger.
    2. Allow the additions to go through, but create a new ~validate~
       method that checks for such cycles.
    3. Create separate configuration object which can be attached to
       the root of the tree, which allows per-tree configuration of
       the behavior - this does allow for the user to take control,
       but also introduces complications during tree mergers and
       spitting subtrees.
    4. Create a registry (to be maintained at the root?) of all nodes,
       and use this for validating the node additions (and preventing
       duplicates).  This needs to be a hash (to allow O(1) access),
       and will sacrifice memory.  There might be a need to
       restructure the internals to make better use of memory.




*** TODO Clarify (or fix) the scenario whether a root node without children is a leaf
    Issue http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=29549&group_id=1215&atid=4793

* R0.9.0
*** TODO Fix the inconsistency of returning root as its first sibling, and returning a nil instead.  Ditto for last sibling.
*** TODO fix the inconsistency of returning nil for the root, and an empty array for nodes which have no siblings.
*** TODO We should perhaps return nil as root's root.
*** TODO The semantic of length is probably unclear.  Should return the node_depth instead (or remove the method)
    The current equivalence of length to size should also be removed.


* Unplanned / Not assigned to any release
*** TODO Fix the TreeNode#root method to return nil for root's root.
*** TODO Fix the marshal_load method.  This probably needs to be a class method.
*** TODO Fix the semantic inconsistency between the TreeNode#first|lastSibling method and the siblings method w.r.t. the root
*** TODO Create the basic UML diagrams and upload to the Site
    DEADLINE: <2010-01-04 Mon>

*** DONE Fix bug # [[http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php%3Ffunc%3Ddetail&aid%3D22535&group_id%3D1215&atid%3D4793][22535]]: The method Tree::TreeNode#depth is a misnomer.  The current definition actually provides the height function. :ARCHIVE:
    DEADLINE: <2010-01-09 Sat> CLOSED: [2010-01-03 Sun 22:15]

*** TODO Add a YAML export method to the TreeNode class.

*** DONE Get the version control moved from CVS to Subversion (request submitted to RubyForge) :ARCHIVE:
    CLOSED: [2010-01-02 Sat 17:58]

*** DONE Add logic in Rakefile to read the file list from Manifest.txt file.              :ARCHIVE:
  CLOSED: [2009-12-31 Thu 23:37]
*** TODO Fix the inconsistency of returning root as its last sibling, and returning a nil array for siblings of the node
*** TODO marshal_load method probably should be a class method.  It currently clobbers self.
*** TODO Fix the inconsistency of returning root as its first/last sibling, and returning a nil array for siblings of the node
