## What is RubyTree?

[RubyTree](http://rubytree.rubyforge.org) is a simple and general
purpose implementation of the
[Tree data structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29)
for the Ruby language. RubyTree aims to provide a simple to use node
based model for the conceptual tree, and the ability to extend the
model into specialized cases in user-generated code using generic
APIs.

The current version provides implementations of:

* A general purpose node-based tree data structure, and
*  A binary tree

Future versions may include other tree implementations such as the
balanced binary, AVL and Red-Black trees.

RubyTree has a full and extensive API and sample usage
[documentation](http://rubytree.rubyforge.org/rdoc/index.html).

RubyTree is available as a
[Rubygem](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubytree) and is released under
the [BSD License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php).
