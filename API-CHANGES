= API Changes in RubyTree

This file documents various API level changes that have been made to the RubyTree package.  Note that new API additions
are not specifically documented unless they are related to incompatibilities from the previous release.

Note: API level changes are expected to reduce dramatically after the 1.x release.  In most cases, an alternative will
be provided to ensure relatively smooth transition to the new APIs.

== Release 0.7.0 Changes

- Converted all exceptions thrown on invalid method arguments to from 'RuntimeError' to 'ArgumentError'.  This impacts the
  following methods:

  - Tree::TreeNode#new
  - Tree::TreeNode#add
  - Tree::TreeNode#[]
  - Tree::BinaryTree#add

- Added Tree::TreeNode#level as a new alias for Tree::TreeNode#nodeDepth

- Added new methods Tree::TreeNode#in_degree and Tree::TreeNode#out_degree to report the node's degree stats

- Tree::TreeNode#isOnlyChild? now returns +true+ for a root node.

- Tree::TreeNode#nextSibling and Tree::TreeNode#previousSibling now return +nil+ for a root node.

- Tree::TreeNode#add and Tree::TreeNode#<< now throw an ArgumentError exception if a nil node is passed as an argument.

== Release 0.6.1 Changes

- Deprecated the Tree::TreeNode#depth method as it was returning an incorrect depth value.  Have introduced a new replacement
  method (Tree::TreeNode#nodeDepth) which returns the correct result.
